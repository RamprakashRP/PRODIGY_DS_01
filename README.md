# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a provided dataset, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of categorical or continuous variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is the [world_population_dataset](https://github.com/kindo-tk/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/worldpopulationdata.csv). This dataset contains records of the population from the year 2001 to 2022.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.
   - Used functions such as `dropna()`, `fillna()`, and `median()` to clean the data.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar charts and stacked charts to visualize the distribution of categorical or continuous variables.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variables in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
